# Sim Card Diagnostics

Simple sim card diagnostics regarding network connection, gsm signal and device imei information are available for retrieval in the API as well. 
The diagnostics information are updated regularly as we receive information regarding a sim card from the network. 
This history for the diagnostics of a sim card is not available, only the latest information that we received is available in the API.

The information can be retrieved by following the URL:

`GET /simcards/{icc}/diagnostics`

!!!info
    Only sim cards that have been activated can be requested for diagnostics information

!!!info
    Any of the properties except for the ICC may also be `null` when the diagnostic information is returned. 
    If a value is `null` it simply means we have received no information about that property from the sim card.
