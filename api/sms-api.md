# About
Using this API, you are able to send SMS directly through our SMSC.

We support both numeric and alphanumeric senders. Some basic rules apply:

* For numeric senders: You must own the MSISDN (telephone number) specified.
* For alphanumeric senders: Maximum 11 characters. Your request will also be checked against a blacklist to combat simple fraud attempts.
