# About
This is the (evolving) documentation for the **AxonMobile SimCard API** for integration purposes.

The API is continuously being developed and once it reaches a certain feature state, versioning will be introduced.

To access this API, you need to have your designated API key and secret at the ready.

# URLs

The API is available at: `https://preprod.axonmobileiot.com/simcardexternalapi`

# Authentication

The API simply uses HTTP basic auth and expects your API key and secret.

### Example

Let's imagine that:

* API key: `7defeb3b-f03a-4cd8-a3c2-fea45a25abe4`
* API secret: `toyqdCALFai19uWofIDlxb6hp7ZhOlaf9sx5hTEK1GIOJKUR3y4wAkPTrzvSyHJz`
